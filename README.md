# PyCity Schools Analysis


## Analysis Summary

Using data from the 9th to 12th grade student's math and reading scores, in addition to data from the schools such as budget, type and size, we pretend to analyze trends and obtain conclusions about the schools performance in the Pycity District.

## Conclusions

- Students in the District are doing better in reading than math. 85.80% passed the reading test while 74.98% passed the math test.
- However, only 65.17% of the students passed both tests, which means that 34.83% are failing at least one of the tests.
- The highest-performing school by overall passing is Cabrera High School with 91.33%
- The lowest-performing school by overall passing is Rodriguez High School with 52.99%
- The average score in each school tends to remain at a similar level among the different grades.
- The highest average scores by grade on each test are both from Holden High School. (11th grade with 85.00 in math and 12th grade with 84.69 in reading)
- It seems to be a indirect relationship between performance and average spending per student. The average scores and passing percentages decrease at a higher average spending per student.
- Large school performance is lower than medium or small size schools. Overall passing is 58.28% in schools with more than 2000 students while it is around 90% in schools with less than 2000 students.
- The 5 highest-performing schools (by % overall passing) are charter schools, and the 5 lowest-performing schools are district schools.
- Average scores and passing percentages are higher in charter schools. For example, Overall Passing is 90.43% in Charter Schools and only 53.67% in District Schools.
